# Statistics on Exoplanet Findings
 
We report here the statistical analysis of all the confirmed Exoplanets by using Python. The data is separated into four parts as follows: First of all Kepler: The findings of Kepler space telescope (2009), second is of TESS (2018), next is of K2 (2014), and finally the findings of some ground based observatories. The statistical analysis is based on the spectral Types of hosts, Apparent(V) Magnitude of hosts, Radius of discovered exoplanets, and the Number of exoplanets per host star. The data here is collected from NASA Exoplanet Archive.
